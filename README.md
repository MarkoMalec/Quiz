# Quiz

Demo => https://marko-malec-quiz.netlify.app

This is my first attempt at creating a quiz in vanilla Javascript.
Code is a bit messy but but I'll polish it out eventually.

Also, I am going to re-create this quiz in React.

## In order for this app to work you will need a server (XAMPP or VSCode Live Server will do).


Anyways, try it out and if you have any suggestions or fixes, feel free to pull!

Happy coding!
