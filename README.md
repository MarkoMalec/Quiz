# Quiz

This is my first attempt at creating a quiz in vanilla Javascript.
While I know that Google should be one of the skills used in coding, I tried not to use it on this one because I really wanted
to think with my own head.

It has its issues that need polishing but I'll keep coming back to it and re-write the code as needed to polish it out.
I am still in a learning process anyway.

The code itself is a bit messy and I am not sure if that is simply because of vanilla JS's nature or my current state of knowledge :D
Although, sometimes I do find a way to clean up a part where I had few lines of code and put it into one.

Anyways, try it out and if you have any suggestions or fixes, feel free to pull!

Happy coding!
